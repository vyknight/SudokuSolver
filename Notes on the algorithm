My intentions with this project is to create a sudoku solver algorithm that would first use the steps I would use as a
Sudoku player before using a conventional algorithm.

Human player procedures:
Scan each square for possible numbers, fill in whichever value is guaranteed
Create a sub grid for all the possible values for each square, if there are squares that are guaranteed to not be of the
value we're searching for and use these blocked off squares for scanning.
Repeat the above two steps until the grid is complete or frozen.

Then use one of the traditional algorithms to finish off the rest.
